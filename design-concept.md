## Iconography and Visual Elements

### Icon Style
- **Outline Style**: Clean, consistent 2px stroke weight
- **Rounded Corners**: 2px radius for friendliness
- **Size Standards**: 24px (small), 32px (medium), 48px (large)

### RTL Considerations
- **Motion Icons**: Reversed for RTL (delivery vehicles, arrows)
- **Navigation**: Back buttons point right in Arabic
- **Text Icons**: Message bubbles and text-related icons mirrored
- **Preserved Icons**: Logos, universal symbols, clocks remain unchanged

### Visual Elements
- **Cards**: 12px border radius, subtle shadows (0px 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1))
- **Buttons**: 8px border radius, clear hierarchy with primary/secondary styles
- **Images**: Rounded corners, optimized for fast loading

## Layout Principles for Mobile-First Design

### Grid System
- **Base Unit**: 8px grid system for consistent spacing
- **Margins**: 16px horizontal margins on mobile
- **Padding**: 12px internal padding for cards and containers
- **Vertical Rhythm**: 24px spacing between major sections

### Component Hierarchy
1. **Navigation**: Bottom tab bar (sticky) + top header
2. **Content Areas**: Scrollable main content with clear sections
3. **Action Areas**: Fixed bottom buttons for primary actions
4. **Feedback**: Toast notifications and modal overlays

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 320px - 768px (primary focus)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px (secondary consideration)
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (web app version)

## RTL Considerations for Arabic Support

### Layout Mirroring
- **Navigation**: Tab bars, headers, and menus flip horizontally
- **Content Flow**: Text alignment, card layouts, and progress indicators reverse
- **Interactive Elements**: Sliders, switches, and steppers mirror direction

### Typography Considerations
- **Text Direction**: Proper RTL text flow with correct character connections
- **Mixed Content**: English text within Arabic content remains LTR
- **Numbers**: Western numerals right-aligned, Eastern Arabic numerals follow RTL
- **Line Height**: Increased by 20% for Arabic text to accommodate diacritics

### Cultural Adaptations
- **Prayer Time Integration**: Optional prayer time notifications
- **Ramadan Mode**: Special UI themes and features during Ramadan
- **Local Customs**: Respectful imagery and color choices

## Dark Mode Implementation

### Design Principles
- **Contrast**: Maintain WCAG AA compliance (4.5:1 minimum)
- **Hierarchy**: Use elevation and subtle borders instead of shadows
- **Colors**: Warmer tones to reduce eye strain
- **Images**: Slight opacity reduction for better integration

### Component Adaptations
- **Cards**: Elevated appearance with subtle borders
- **Text**: High contrast white/gray hierarchy
- **Buttons**: Adjusted colors maintaining brand recognition
- **Icons**: Consistent stroke weight with proper contrast

## Accessibility Features

### Visual Accessibility

- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for all interactive elements

### Interaction Accessibility
- **Voice Over**: Proper semantic markup and screen reader support
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility for web version
- **Haptic Feedback**: Subtle vibrations for important actions

## Animation and Micro-Interactions

### Animation Principles
- **Duration**: 200-300ms for most transitions
- **Easing**: Ease-out for entering, ease-in for exiting
- **Purpose**: Functional animations that guide user attention

### Key Animations
- **Page Transitions**: Slide animations respecting RTL direction

## Conclusion

The visual system is designed to scale across the entire Araba ecosystem while maintaining consistency and brand recognition. The emphasis on RTL support and multilingual capabilities ensures the app will resonate with the diverse UAE market.
